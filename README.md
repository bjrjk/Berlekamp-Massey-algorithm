# Berlekamp-Massey-algorithm
A implement of Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.  It's a cloned repository.

It can be used to infer the formula of a number sequence, especially in the competitive programming, 
since some kinds of problem in contests has only one or two integer inputs, and the C++ code that 
produces the sequence in complexity O(N) can be generated by the program automatically.

The data to feed are generated by a naive brute force algorithm.
